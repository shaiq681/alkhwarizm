[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shaiq681/alkhwarizm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shaiq681/alkhwarizm)

## Overview

The current package holds implementation of [Euclidean's sieve Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) and [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for finding the shortest path between two nodes.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("shaiq681/alkhwarizm")
```
### Installation Notes
Please make sure that **.Renvironment** does not have GITHUB_PAT by default. Refer [Issue](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1566)

## Usage

- The Library uses the function `euclidean()` to find the Greatest Common Divisor between two Integers. 
- The Library uses the function `dijkstra()` to find the shortest path between a single node and its neighbours.
